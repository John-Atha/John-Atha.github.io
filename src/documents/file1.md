## Studies

#### National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)
* Right now, I am an undergraduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of NTUA.
* I am planning to graduate by the end of 2022, with a GPA of around 4.5 out of 5.
* The studies program allows the students to take certain fields' courses during the last 2.5 years of their studies.
* I have taken courses about Computer Networks, Systems, and Software, focusing on the last one.

#### Extracurricular online courses
* During the year 2021, I have been looking for online courses to take alongside my University studies.
* My main goal was to gain new skills and build more projects closer to the real world.
* I did some research and found these two appealing courses about web development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, powered by HarvardX:
    * [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home)
    * [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home)
* I completed those courses and gained the two following certificates:

</div>

* Currently I am taking the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) at Coursera. The specialization consists of the following courses:
    * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
    * [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
    * [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
    * [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
    * [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning)

* I have completed the first course (with grade 100%) and gained the following certificate:
