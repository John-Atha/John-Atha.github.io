### Hobbies

##### Football âš½

Except for computer science, I enjoy playing football and exercising in general.
I have been on a football team since I was six years old.
Being part of a sports team has taught me to collaborate and work for a specific team's goal.
I have learned to be disciplined and follow some necessary for the function of the team rules.
Football, and sports in general, teach you patience and that all the work and effort you put in pay off sooner or later.
So, I think that all these values I have earned have prepared me for working in a professional environment where collaboration is needed.

##### Music ðŸŽ¸

I also love listening to music and playing the guitar to relax and forget about daily problems.
When I got into the university, I started learning to play the guitar on an amateur level, following online tutorials.
This process of learning a new skill, without explicit help from a teacher, has developed my search skills.
