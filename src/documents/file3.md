### Fields

* In general, I like implementing the concepts of data structures and algorithms to solve problems.
* Above DSA, I am also interested in web and AI-ML development.

#### Web development üï∏Ô∏è
* I love building web projects of various complexity and size.
* I like deploying small web projects and use them as a tool in my daily life, replacing other well-known web services.
* I am interested in both back-end and front-end web development, as they both have their beauty.
* I enjoy the process of making my back-end modules collaborate harmoniously with my front-end modules.
* I like building and documenting REST APIS that can work as a standalone tool and be used effortlessly by other developers.
When building a front-end module, I enjoy the process of handling and adjusting the asynchronously retrieved data.
* I also love the process of making decisions that lead to a cleanly designed front-end and a smooth user experience.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ü§ñ
* I think that the process of building a machine that can make decisions without explicit instructions is beyond revolutionary.
* Artificial Intelligence cannot replace the creativity of human beings but can work with us and extend our capabilities.
* I love the process of modelizing a problem in such a way that a machine can understand it.
* I am excited by the application of classic data structures and algorithms in the AI field.
* I am in awe when building a neural network and seeing its accuracy increasing as the training process goes by.

### Favourite Programming Languages
* In general, I prefer high-level programming languages.
* I love using **Python** for AI-ML and back-end web development. I believe a language of this level allows the developer to focus on the main idea behind a project and be more productive.
* I consider **C++** a language that is as "strict" as any other language should be, allowing the developer to have a better idea about what is lying behind the code and therefore helping him prevent many mistakes.
* I also enjoy using **Javascript** for front-end web development. Even though I feel like it's more tricky than the previous ones and can lead to difficultly detectable bugs, I consider it an appealing language to use.

### Favourite Frameworks and Libraries
* **React** ‚öõÔ∏è: When it comes to front-end web development, I think React is the smoothest framework to use. I admire that it gives the ability to build reusable components. I also enjoy the variety of pre-built components that can be installed as npm packages and help the developer not have to code everything from scratch. I love the way it handles the state of the components and the side effects, allowing you to have total control of the web app at each time.
* **Django**: I consider Django a must for back-end web development. Even though it can be used for building full-stack web projects following the MVC architecture, I love combining it with the Django-Rest-Framework library to build RESTful APIs. I love how well-organized the code can become if you take advantage of its clear file structure. The most appealing part of Django that, in my opinion, differentiates it from the other back-end frameworks is its effortless-to-use entity manager.
* **Keras** Tensorflow: I think that Keras is the smoothest library for building, training, and testing a neural network. The amazingly high-level way of adding layers to the network and defining their parameters allows you to focus on experimenting on them without wasting time on building the network from scratch.
