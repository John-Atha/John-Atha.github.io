## Portfolio

* My name is Ioannis (Giannis) Athanasiou

* This repo contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

* It is deployed on gh-pages.

* It simulates a simple desktop environment, giving the ability to:
    * open directories and markdown files with information about myself
    * listen to music
    * play some classic games
    * navigate to my github profile and repositories
    * open my projects deployments
    * use a CMD to do these stuff
